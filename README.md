# SimpLog

## What does SimpLog do?
SimpLog is used to easily write Log files from your application without giving much thought to the underlying process.

## Why use SimpLog and not Log4NET?
To be honest, I tried using Log4NET. Everything was so complicated and designed to be deployed in large-scale applications. I undertstand that these kinds of applications require scalability, fine-tuning and a lot of other fancy-sounding words.
However, this isn't what I need! Basically, I want to write lines into a file, with proper formating and timestamps.
To answer your questions: Use SimpLog if you just want basic logging ability in your application.

## How to use?
Download the lastest release or development version, create a new `FileLogger()` object and you're ready to go.
